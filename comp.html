            <p>The advantage of owning the newest iPhone is that they will have the Latest software and hardware.Also iPhones tend to receive longer software updates compared to Android
               The iPhone <br> has a better and smoother complaboration with software with other apple devices like the iPad and Mac. iPhones look very preminum and visaully appealing you may want to buy a iPhone bcause of its nice build quality.
                having a phone that has ceramic shild glass and stainless steel frames will make your iPhones last longer and look amazing. For long term having a iPhone is the better choice because of the longer versions of updates and secuirty patches. </p>

            <h id="dis">Cons</h>
            <p> A big reason why  geting the iPhone may not be the better option since iPhones are nomrally more expensive than samsung models when having less features. it may be better to by a older model Samsung than a older model iPhone.<br>
            The older models of the samsung devices have the ability to have extendable storage which can save alot of money. The increase of storage wit devices is too expensive to increase storage on iPhones about Â£300 increase for more storage.</p>

                    <p>Samsung devices have a wider range of devices at very different price points.You can find a phone that will do what you want.For example the S series phones you are getting the best of the best of what samsung has to offer. The A series have affordable devices and high spec devices.since Samsung devices run android the software is very customisable.
                         For example the home screen. Android offer third party apps that have control of the phones system.Samsung devices are know for very good battery life and have fast charging. The Google play store has a wider range of apps than the apple store. </p>

                    <p>Samsung does okay in consistantcy for updates on their phones However is not better than iphones. iPhones will recieve 5 or more years on software upddates. Samsung phones tend to come preload with several apps that most people will not like.These unwanted apps are clled bloatware and the apps can take uo storage and slow down the device over time.<br>
                    depending on the quantity of the bloatware it can also degrade battery life.iphone does not have alot of bloatware.</p>
